'''
You are given a primitive calculator that can perform the following three operations with
the current number 洧논: multiply 洧논 by 2, multiply 洧논 by 3, or add 1 to 洧논. Your goal is given a
positive integer 洧녵, find the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number 洧녵
starting from the number 1.

Solution:
We will be using dynamic approach to find out the number of operations.

Example:
Input:
5
Output:
Operations Required: 3
Sequence: 1 2 4 5

Input:
96234
Output:
Operations Required: 14
Sequence: [1, 3, 9, 10, 11, 33, 99, 297, 891, 2673, 8019, 16038, 16039, 48117, 96234]
